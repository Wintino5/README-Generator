# README-Generator
Professional README Generator

## Description

In this challenge we use Node JS to create a README Generator. By installing inquirer we give the user the ability to put their information when prompted and when they are done a ReadMe.md file is generated. The file includes information about their project as well as their project title. This was a good challenge that helped me to understand the basics of Node JS and its capabilities.
